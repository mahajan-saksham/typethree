# Optimization Strategies

## 1. Infrastructure Optimization

### Resource Scaling
- **Dynamic Scaling**
  - Auto-scaling for web and application servers

  - Scale-in during off-peak hours (10 PM - 6 AM)
  - Expected savings: 20-25% on compute costs

- **Reserved Capacity**
  - Reserved instances for baseline load
  - 1-year commitments for predictable workloads
  - Spot instances for batch processing
  - Expected savings: 30-40% on committed compute

### Database Optimization
- **Read-Write Splitting**
  - Primary instance for writes
  - Read replicas for queries
  - Analytics on separate instances
  - Expected improvement: 60-70% read performance

- **Indexing Strategy**
  - Optimize indexes for common queries
  - Compound indexes for filtered queries
  - Time-partitioned collections for time-series data
  - Expected improvement: 50-60% query performance

### Caching Strategy
- **Multi-layer Caching**
  - Browser cache (client-side)
  - CDN cache (edge network)
  - API cache (application layer)
  - Data cache (database layer)
  - Expected improvement: 70-80% response time reduction

- **Cache Invalidation**
  - Time-based expiration for static content
  - Event-based invalidation for dynamic content
  - Stale-while-revalidate strategy
  - Expected improvement: 99% cache accuracy

## 2. Application Optimization

### Code Performance
- **Lazy Loading**
  - Component-level lazy loading
  - Route-based code splitting
  - On-demand asset loading
  - Expected improvement: 40-50% initial load time

- **API Optimization**
  - Request batching
  - GraphQL for flexible queries
  - Response compression
  - Expected improvement: 30-40% API efficiency

### Data Transfer
- **Payload Optimization**
  - JSON minification
  - GZIP compression
  - Binary protocols for IoT
  - Expected improvement: 60-70% bandwidth reduction

- **Incremental Updates**
  - Delta updates for data
  - Differential synchronization
  - Push vs. pull optimization
  - Expected improvement: 80-90% sync traffic reduction

## 3. User Experience Optimization

### Load Time Optimization
- **Core Web Vitals**
  - LCP optimization (< 2.5s)
  - FID optimization (< 100ms)
  - CLS optimization (< 0.1)
  - Expected improvement: 40% user engagement

- **Progressive Loading**
  - Skeleton screens
  - Progressive image loading
  - Prioritized content rendering
  - Expected improvement: 30% perceived performance

### Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Adaptive components
  - Touch-optimized interfaces
  - Expected improvement: 50% mobile conversion

- **Offline Capabilities**
  - Service worker implementation
  - Offline data storage
  - Background synchronization
  - Expected improvement: 60% resilience to network issues

## 4. Cost Optimization

### Resource Allocation
- **Right-sizing**
  - Matching resources to requirements
  - Regular resource auditing
  - Predictive provisioning
  - Expected savings: 25-30% on overprovisioned resources

- **Lifecycle Management**
  - Development/Staging/Production separation
  - Non-production environment scheduling
  - Ephemeral environments for testing
  - Expected savings: 40-50% on non-production costs

### Service Optimization
- **Tiered Storage**
  - Hot storage for active data
  - Cold storage for archives
  - Backup optimization
  - Expected savings: 60-70% on storage costs

- **Third-party Services**
  - Usage-based plan selection
  - Consolidation of overlapping services
  - Self-hosting vs. SaaS analysis
  - Expected savings: 20-30% on SaaS costs

## 5. Monitoring & Continuous Improvement

### Performance Tracking
- **Key Metrics**
