# Type 3 Advantages Icons - Illustration Prompt

## Design Brief

Create a consistent set of icons/illustrations for the "Type 3 Advantages" section featuring eight distinct benefits of the Type 3 platform. The illustrations should follow the existing design language while effectively communicating each unique advantage.

## Visual Style Guidelines

### Master Style Specifications

**Overall Approach:** All illustrations should follow these exact specifications to maintain perfect visual consistency.

### Color Palette
- **Primary color**: Lime green (#65E4A1) - Use for main elements, highlights, and emphasis points
- **Secondary color**: Teal accent (#00BFFF at 70% opacity) - For secondary elements and subtle accents
- **Background**: Transparent (no background) to allow website's dark gradient to show through
- **Line color**: White (#FFFFFF at 90% opacity) for all outlines and strokes
- **Shadow**: Primary color at 20% opacity for subtle inner glows

### Design Elements
- **Style**: Clean, tech-focused line art with subtle futuristic elements
- **Stroke width**: Precisely 2.5px for primary elements, 1.5px for secondary details
- **Corners**: 4px rounded corners on all shapes, 2px rounded caps on all lines
- **Depth**: Consistent lighting from top-left (315° angle) with subtle highlights
- **Fill**: 20% fill for larger areas, gradient fills (primary to secondary) for focal points
- **Glow effects**: Subtle outer glow (2px, primary color at 15% opacity) on main elements

### Composition Rules (REQUIRED FOR ALL ICONS)
- **Canvas size**: Exactly 240×240px with content centered in a safe area of 200×200px
- **Output size**: Deliver at 240×240px, but design must remain crisp when scaled to 64×64px
- **Grid system**: 8×8 grid (30px cells with 4px gutters) for consistent placement
- **Centerpiece**: Each icon must have one prominent central element occupying 50-60% of safe area
- **Supporting elements**: 2-3 smaller elements (15-20% of safe area) arranged around centerpiece
- **White space**: Maintain at least 20px padding around all edges of the content
- **Visual balance**: All icons should have similar visual weight when viewed as a collection

## Technical Specifications

- **Format**: SVG (scalable vector graphics)
- **Dimensions**: Final delivery size 240×240px (source files at 480×480px for higher detail)
- **Artboard**: Square canvas with 20px transparent padding on all sides
- **File naming**: `type3-advantage-[concept].svg` (e.g., type3-advantage-quality.svg)
- **Optimization**: Files should be optimized for web use (compressed, unnecessary metadata removed)
- **Size**: Maximum file size 15KB per icon
- **Responsiveness**: Design must remain crisp and clear when scaled down to 64px (mobile) or up to 120px (desktop)
- **Background Treatment**: Transparent background (alpha channel) to allow website's dark gradient to show behind icons

## Implementation Notes

- Icons should have a transparent background to blend with the dark card backgrounds
- Each icon will be displayed within a lime green accent circle (10% opacity) that's applied in the website code
- All icons should work equally well in both light and dark contexts
- The icons should be recognizable even at small sizes (minimum 48px display size)

## Brand Personality

- **Innovative**: Convey forward-thinking technology and solutions
- **Professional**: Clean, precise design that reflects professionalism
- **Modern**: Contemporary styling that appeals to developers and tech users
- **Powerful**: Subtle references to capability and performance
- **User-centric**: Illustrations should focus on benefits to the platform users

## Deliverables

- 8 individual SVG files, named according to convention
- Preview of all icons together in a grid layout
