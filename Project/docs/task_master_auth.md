- **RLS Policies**: Row-Level Security enforces data access controls at the database level
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions are assigned based on user roles
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages prevent information leakage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify Supabase URL and Anon Key in `.env` file
   - Check browser console for specific error messages
   - Ensure user exists in the Supabase auth system

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify the user has an entry in `task_permissions` table
   - Check that RLS policies are properly configured
   - Ensure user role is correctly set in user metadata or profile

3. **Session Issues**
   - Clear browser localStorage if experiencing persistent session problems
   - Check session timeout settings in configuration
   - Verify refresh token functionality is working

### Debugging

For debugging authentication issues:

1. Check Supabase dashboard for authentication logs
2. Monitor network requests in browser developer tools
3. Verify JWT token expiration and claims using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)

## Testing

To test the authentication integration:

1. **Login Testing**
   - Test successful login
   - Test invalid credentials
   - Test account lockout after multiple failures

2. **Permission Testing**
   - Test task creation with different user roles
   - Test task deletion permissions
   - Test task assignment capabilities

3. **Security Testing**
   - Test direct database access bypass attempts
   - Test token manipulation
   - Test cross-site scripting protection

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the authentication system:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Integration with authenticator apps
   - SMS verification

2. **Team-Based Permissions**
   - Group-based permission system
   - Project-specific roles

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging of authentication events
   - Task modification audit trail
