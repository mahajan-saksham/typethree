# Type 3 Solar Platform - Codebase Maintenance

This document outlines the current state of the codebase, recent cleanup efforts, and recommended tasks for future maintenance, performance improvements, and security enhancements.

**Last Updated:** April 19, 2025

## Recently Completed Tasks

### Codebase Cleanup
- ✅ Removed unused admin pages that were no longer in the navigation:
  - `/src/pages/admin/RooftopConsultations.tsx`
  - `/src/pages/admin/RooftopProposals.tsx`
- ✅ Updated AdminRoutes.tsx to remove references to these deleted components:
  - Removed import statements
  - Removed route definitions
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports in AdminLayout.tsx:
  - Removed `UserCheck` icon import 
  - Removed `FileText` icon import
- ✅ Removed the unused Contact page:
  - `/src/pages/Contact.tsx` (was commented out in App.tsx routing)
- ✅ Updated navigation in AdminLayout to match actual used features
- ✅ Updated Footer.tsx to align with current navigation structure
- ✅ Added Support Tickets functionality with proper frontend and database integration

## Pending Tasks

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Remove hardcoded API keys in `supabaseClient.ts`
  - Current implementation includes fallback hardcoded Supabase API key
  - Should only use environment variables with no hardcoded fallbacks
- [ ] Implement proper input validation on all forms
- [ ] Ensure all API calls have proper error handling
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy headers

### Deployment & Lazy Loading Fixes
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix lazy loading implementation in `App.tsx` to resolve Vercel deployment issues:
  - Replace custom `lazyLoad` function with standard `React.lazy` + static imports
  - Remove `@vite-ignore` comments from dynamic imports
  - Ensure proper relative import paths with exact case sensitivity
  - Add error boundaries around suspense components for graceful failure
- [ ] Add `vercel.json` configuration for proper SPA routing on deployment
- [ ] Implement testing procedure for builds before deployment
- [ ] Review and update Vite configuration if needed for proper path resolution

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Add code splitting for admin and dashboard routes to reduce initial bundle size
- [ ] Remove debug console logs from production code (e.g., `console.log('Dashboard index module loaded')`)
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical resources
- [ ] Add memory management for components that might cause memory leaks
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexes and limiting result sets

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Add proper loading states and error boundaries around lazy-loaded components
- [ ] Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types across all components
- [ ] Add stronger typing for Supabase data models
- [ ] Setup a linter with enforced rules across the entire codebase
- [ ] Set up automated testing for critical components and functionality:
  - Unit tests for utility functions
  - Integration tests for forms and data processing
  - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Create a more robust error handling strategy throughout the application

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Implement proper responsive design for all remaining pages
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling across all components
- [ ] Add proper loading indicators for async operations
- [ ] Implement better form validation feedback
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)

### Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Document database schema with relationships and constraints
- [ ] Create user flow diagrams for complex processes
- [ ] Add inline code documentation for complex functions

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies (non-breaking)
- [ ] Review and optimize database performance
- [ ] Clean up unused assets

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Comprehensive performance review
- [ ] Major dependency updates

## Tech Debt

- [ ] Refactor authentication flow to use more modern patterns
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate code in dashboard components
- [ ] Move hardcoded values to configuration files
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback throughout the application
- [ ] Replace custom dynamic import utility with standardized bundler-friendly alternatives

## Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Vercel Lazy Loading Issue

**Issue**: The custom `lazyLoad` function in `App.tsx` causes module loading failures on Vercel deployment.

**Root Causes**:
1. Dynamic import paths with string manipulation cannot be statically analyzed by Vite/Rollup
2. The `@vite-ignore` comment prevents proper code splitting during build
3. Computed path strings like `./src/${path}` create paths that don't match the actual file system structure
4. Case sensitivity differences between development (macOS) and production (Linux/Vercel)

**Solution Approach**:
1. Replace all dynamic imports with static imports using standard `React.lazy`:
   ```tsx
   // Before:
   const Home = lazyLoad('./pages/Home');
   
   // After:
   const Home = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Home'));
   ```

2. Create a proper `vercel.json` configuration for SPA routing:
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Test build locally before deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview  # Test locally to verify lazy loading works
   ```

4. Implement proper error boundaries around lazy-loaded components for graceful failure handling

**Expected Outcome**: All lazy-loaded routes will function correctly on Vercel deployment with proper code splitting and no 404 errors for module loading.

## Future Architectural Considerations

- [ ] Consider implementing a state management solution (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- [ ] Evaluate migration to a more modular architecture
- [ ] Consider implementing a proper CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add analytics to track user behavior and performance metrics
