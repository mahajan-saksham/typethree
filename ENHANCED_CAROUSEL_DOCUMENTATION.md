## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/components/ProductCarousel/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProductCarousel.tsx           # Original carousel (preserved)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EnhancedProductCarousel.tsx   # New enhanced version
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                      # Exports both versions
```

### Configuration Toggle
In `src/pages/Home.tsx`, easily switch between versions:
```typescript
// Configuration: Set to true to use the enhanced carousel
const USE_ENHANCED_CAROUSEL = true;
```

### Featured Products Data Structure
Enhanced with additional metadata:
```typescript

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Visual Hierarchy**
- **Primary information** (capacity, price) in large, bold typography
- **Secondary details** (savings, features) in smaller, colored text
- **Action items** (CTA buttons) with high contrast and animation

### 2. **Color Psychology**
- **Primary Yellow** (#CCFF00) for solar energy and main CTAs
- **Green accents** for savings and positive metrics
- **Blue accents** for trust indicators (warranty, reliability)
- **Orange accents** for urgency and ROI information

### 3. **Spatial Design**
- **Generous whitespace** for breathing room
- **Consistent 8pt grid system** for alignment
- **Balanced content distribution** across the card
- **Strategic use of borders and shadows** for depth

### 4. **Motion Design**
- **Purposeful animations** that guide attention
- **Smooth easing curves** using `ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]`
- **Choreographed sequences** with progressive delays
- **Performance-optimized** using CSS transforms

## Performance Considerations

### 1. **Optimized Animations**
- Uses `transform` and `opacity` for 60fps animations
- Minimal repaints with GPU-accelerated properties
- Proper `will-change` hints for performance

### 2. **Image Optimization**
- Lazy loading with error fallbacks
- Optimized image sizes from Supabase storage
- Progressive enhancement with placeholder images

### 3. **Code Splitting**
- Separate component for enhanced carousel
- Conditional loading based on configuration
- Tree-shaking optimized imports

## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Enable Enhanced Carousel**
```typescript
// In src/pages/Home.tsx
const USE_ENHANCED_CAROUSEL = true;
```

### 2. **Fallback to Original**
```typescript
// To revert to original carousel
const USE_ENHANCED_CAROUSEL = false;
```

### 3. **Customization**
Update the `featuredProducts` array in `EnhancedProductCarousel.tsx` to modify:
- Product selection
- Pricing information
- Feature highlights
- Badge labels

## Browser Support
